# ME Paint

ME Paint is a Whiteboard app that seeks to replace the recently disgraced MS Paint. MS Paint used to be my favorite whiteboard app. It was simple, pre-installed on my pc, and fun to use. Windows 11 changed that. Along with the many issues facing the new MS Paint,
the one that I find most irredeemable about it is that you can not start a canvas with a black background. As someone who ~~uses~~ used MS Paint for solving LeetCode problems, I liked to have a dark background because it was less strenuous on my eyes. I decided 
to take matters into my own hands and make ME Paint.

## Installation
ME Paint is currently in early stages of development, but it will come with an exe that you simple run and you are all set.

- Control-z: Undo
